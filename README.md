## 💻 Getting Started <a name="getting-started"></a>

## Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

## Learn More

You can learn more in the [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started).

### Prerequisites

- Installation of Node.js, Node Package Manager, webpack module bundler, and Babel 
- Functioning computer Internet connection 
- Basic understanding of Git and GitHub
- Basic JavaScript, HTML, and CSS knowledge

### Setup

To clone the repository using an SSH key, including a certificate issued by your organization's SSH certificate authority, click SSH, then click . To clone a repository using GitHub CLI, click GitHub CLI, then click . The clipboard icon for copying the URL to clone a repository with GitHub CLI

4 - Open Git Bash.

5 - Change the current working directory to the location where you want the cloned directory.

6 - Type git clone, and then paste the URL you copied earlier.

7 - Press Enter to create your local clone.

8 - To get started with the exact same setup, don't forget to install webpack, babel, and jest on your computer!

- [The setup of webpack](https://webpack.js.org/guides/getting-started/)
- [The setup of jest](https://jest-bot.github.io/jest/docs/getting-started.html)
- [The setup of babel](https://babeljs.io/setup)

Please read the documentation to get familiar with each of them!

### Install

- A code editor (e.g. VSC) /text editor (e.g. notepad++) Node.js

### Usage

Feel free to use this repo to play around with basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript elements and solutions

### Run tests

No testing required, but you can always take a look at the jest testing environment and create new tests for functions.
